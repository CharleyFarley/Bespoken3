## Solution

## Hosting Solution - Elastic Beanstalk

- I found that the performance of the free tier on Heroku was unsatisfactory, and I didn't want to lost potential views through high latency (Heroku servers are in the US and average over 300ms latency from my testing) and the soft bootup policy for free tier Heroku dynos. As an alternative, I have been getting low latency (19ms on average) pings and better performance from AWS servers in Sydney. 

- I also intend to offer developer services to my own clients, and need to find an acceptable alternative to Heroku to customers.

- After some research, I concluded that AWS in Sydney with an EC2 instance and elastic beanstalk offered the optimum combination of performance and reasonable pricing for Melbourne developers.
